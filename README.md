# About
PingHavoc is a simple Discord spam bot with a few options you can choose from.

# Usage
PingHavoc has no dependencies, all you need is the .exe file.
Usage is very self-explanatory, just run the program and follow the instructions.

# Source Code
You can download and edit the source code with the .py file in the "Source Code" folder.
This requires you to have Python installed, and also have the modules "pyautogui" and "colorama" installed.
If you are wanting to edit the program, I'll assume you know how to install these modules.
View "LICENSE.txt" for more info on what you can do with the source code.
